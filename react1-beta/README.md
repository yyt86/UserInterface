# Assignment: React 1 β (3 Points Total)

Please refer to the [Canvas Assignment](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/219500/assignments/910615) and [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15pvSHEt-GicOy6ommIvjZZXAvfCaRdKEhGtiSyaj2sc/edit) for instructions on completing this assignment. You should copy your code from your React 1 α project to this repository, as that will be your starter code. When you commit and push, ensure that you are commiting and pushing to this react1-beta repository, not react1-alpha. Your deliverable will be the completed Google Doc, attached to the canvas assignment as a PDF, and the GitHub Classroom repository name and latest commit hash.
